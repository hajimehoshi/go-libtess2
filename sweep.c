*   at any valid location of the sweep event
* - if EdgeLeq(e2,e1) as well (at any valid sweep event), then e1 and e2
*   share a common endpoint
* - for each e, e->Dst has been processed, but not e->Org
* - each edge e satisfies VertLeq(e->Dst,event) && VertLeq(event,e->Org)
*   where "event" is the current sweep line event.
* - no edge e has zero length
*
* Invariants for the Mesh (the processed portion).
* - the portion of the mesh left of the sweep line is a planar graph,
*   ie. there is *some* way to embed it in the plane
* - no processed edge has zero length
* - no two processed vertices have identical coordinates
* - each "inside" region is monotone, ie. can be broken into two chains
*   of monotonically increasing vertices according to VertLeq(v1,v2)
*   - a non-invariant: these chains may intersect (very slightly)
*
* Invariants for the Sweep.
* - if none of the edges incident to the event vertex have an activeRegion
*   (ie. none of these edges are in the edge dictionary), then the vertex
*   has only right-going edges.
* - if an edge is marked "fixUpperEdge" (it is a temporary edge introduced
*   by ConnectRightVertex), then it is the only right-going edge from
*   its associated vertex.  (This says that these edges exist only
*   when it is necessary.)
